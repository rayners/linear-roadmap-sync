# CLAUDE.md Instructions

This repository contains a TypeScript CLI project.

## Coding Guidelines
- Prefer official SDKs or clients when interacting with external APIs.
- Keep the CLI non-destructive: do not modify or delete remote resources when fetching data.
- Maintain strict TypeScript typings and avoid using `any` unless absolutely necessary.

## Testing Requirements
- After modifying code, run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to ensure the project compiles cleanly.

## Documentation Notes
- Update README or inline documentation when behavior or dependencies change.
